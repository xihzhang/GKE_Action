# Getting Started
We've included a basic deployment to help get started.
Consult with our [documentation](all.docs.genesys.com/PEC-REP/Current/GIMPEGuide/Overview) for the full configuration and deployment details.

## TL;DR
- Complete the prequisites if any.
- Adjust the `chart.ver` to the release you wish to deploy.
- Adjust the `override_values.yaml` to suit your environment and needs.
- Create the required secrets.
- Run the github actions workflow.

## Configuration

Be sure to update the values defined to align with your environment.
To use the scripting for service deployment, create a deployment secret (deployment-secrets) to store confidential information you may not want held in your repository, or `.yaml` files. 

## Secrets 
Create the standard [pullsecret](../#-considerations) for the workflow: 
`secrets/pullsecret`

Create the following secrets to store confidential information you may not want held in your repository, or `.yaml` files. 
`secrets/deployment_secrets`

|Key|Value|
|-|-|
gim_pgdb_etl_name| gim
  gim_pgdb_etl_password| gim
  gim_pgdb_etl_user| gim
  gim_pgdb_port| 5432
  gim_pgdb_server| reporting-postgres.namespace
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD| pgPASS
  POSTGRES_USER| postgres
  tenant_id| 9350e2fc-a1dd-4c65-8d40-1f75a2e080dd
  tenant_sid| 100
